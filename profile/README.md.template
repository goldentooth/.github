# ðŸ¦· GoldenTooth ðŸ¦·
{{ webring }}

GoldenTooth is my Pi Bramble (Cluster), which I'm building in order to have a fun-sized DevOps/MLOps playground without any important services or data.

I'm building this cluster not to host anything in particular, but to act as something as a Chaos Zoo, where I just deploy things and then try to destroy them to learn about their behavior. No service has, or will have, any purpose other than as a way of learning about itself or the other services.

## About the Cluster

My cluster is built around a PicoCluster 10H with ten Raspberry Pi 4B (8GB RAM, 128GB SD).

Currently, it has the following general structure:
- 1 load balancer/proxy node: Allyrion
  - HAProxy for high availability of the Kubernetes control plane nodes
  - Nginx as a general-purpose HTTP/S proxy
  - NFS server for shared data
  - Consul client
  - Envoy for edge-routing services
- 3 "leader" nodes: Bettley, Cargyll, and Dalt
  - Kubernetes control plane
  - Slurm controllers
  - Consul servers
  - Vault servers
  - Nomad servers
- 6 "follower" nodes: Erenford, Fenn, Gardener, Harlton, Inchfield, and Jast
  - Kubernetes worker nodes
  - Slurm compute nodes
  - Consul clients
  - Nomad clients
