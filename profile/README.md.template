## 🧩 What Is Goldentooth?

Goldentooth is [my](https://github.com/ndouglas/) personal Pi Bramble — a 13-node hybrid cluster: 12 Raspberry Pi 4B nodes (8GB RAM, 128-256GB SD, 120GB-1TB SSD) plus 1 x86 GPU server, all housed in a 12U 10" rack.

That's about as puny as anything with 48+ cores and 96+ GB RAM could possibly be.

It's a sandbox for experimenting with distributed systems, orchestration layers, and failure modes. Services have no purpose but to teach me how they behave under stress, failure, and reconfiguration.

Think of it as a **Chaos Zoo**, a system design playground, or a physical dev environment for recursive infrastructure.
