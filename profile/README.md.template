## üß© What Is Goldentooth?

Goldentooth is [my](https://github.com/ndouglas/) personal Pi Bramble ‚Äî a 12-node Raspberry Pi 4B (8GB RAM, 128-256GB SD, 120GB-1TB SSD) cluster housed in a 12U 10" rack.

It's a sandbox for experimenting with distributed systems, orchestration layers, and failure modes. Services have no purpose but to teach me how they behave under stress, failure, and reconfiguration.

Think of it as a **Chaos Zoo**, a system design playground, or a physical dev environment for recursive infrastructure.
