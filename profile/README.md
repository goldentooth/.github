# GoldenTooth

GoldenTooth is my Pi Bramble (Cluster), which I'm building in order to have a fun-sized DevOps playground without any important services or data.

This will be a valuable resource for me as I study for some Platform Engineering/SRE-related certifications. I'm releasing everything I create here under an [Unlicense](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/) in the hopes that it proves useful to other engineers.

## About the Cluster

My cluster is five Raspberry Pi 4B 8GBs housed in a Pico 5H. I've rolled my own clusters in the past and found the physical details of cable management, power distribution, ventilation, etc aggravating, so I figured it would be worth some cash to have someone else figure out those details for me.
